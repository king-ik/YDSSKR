 legadonia.501.t:0 "A Chance to take the Scania Region!"
 legadonia.501.d:0 "The Empire is still recovering from the 1918 Industrial Disaster that hit it. Its people are very poor, and its military is greatly short-handed. This is probably our last chance to strike fast, overwhelm the Imperial garrison there and take back our lost region of Scania. We have received a secret message from the Francois Republic that they will aid us in case of war, too. This is the ideal scenario, let's strike!"

 #empire.3.d:0 "The Legadonian government has just sent us a message claiming it will not give away any of the rightous Legadonian lands, and that Scania and Gotland should both be in the hands of the Legadonian Federation.

 #empire.3.a:0 "Damn the Legadonians"
 #empire.4.t:0 "Handing over Scania"
 #empire.4.d:0 "We have decided to hand over scania to its rightful ruler, the Legadonian Federation. Now, the chances of a great war breaking in Europe are close to zero. We did the right thing, and now the world is going to start respect us."

 ildoa.20.t:0 "The Istria Crisis"
 ildoa.20.d:0 "The Empire has just sent us an ultimatum stating the 'rightful return' of the region of Istria. They state that Istria was always under their influence, and once was theirs, until it was 'stolen' by us. Of course, all of these are lies but we do not have the military capability to fight against the might of the Empire. What shall we do?"

 ildoa.21.t:0 "Istria Lost!"
 ildoa.21.d:0 "After ruthless fighting, Imperial troops have successfuly invaded Istria. Our troops, although inferior in both equipment and numbers have been fighting ever since, but it seems we cannot hold the enemies back anymore. The purpose of the war, defending the Istria region from the enemies, has been lost and the rest of our country will be the next target. Our cowardly generals suggest that we should surrender to 'avoid any more civilian casualties'. Should we surrender, or keep fighting until the last man dies?"

 empire.6.t:0 "Ildoa Submits"
 empire.6.d:0 "The Ildoans are not fools, they know how to avoid a war they cannot win. The last of the Ildoan troops has just left the Istria region, and our forces are starting to move in.

 empire.6.a:0 "Another victory for the Vaterland!"
 empire.7.t:0 "Ildoa Rejects"
 empire.7.d:0 "The Ildoans are fools to believe they are safe behind their petty little army. The Empire would never give up, even if it means war with the entire world! The time has come to achieve another of our great nation's militaristic ambitions!"

 news.914.t:0 "The Istria Crisis"
 news.914.d:0 "Only hours ago, a war could have broken out if the Ildoan Kingdom did not submit to the Empire's demands of annexing the region of Istria. Although both nations are on good terms with each other, and sometimes even cooperate together in militaristic missions and trade agreements, the Empire's surprising demand was accepted by the Ildoan Kingdom.  At last, peace is restored to the region and the Istrian population was reported cheering at the entering Imperial troops. Europe has become a dangerous place, as nationalism is spreading throughout the world, and in any given moment, any country could start a great war for the sake of a little county."

Republican officials stated earlier that the conference is held to help European countries with the current economy crisis around the world, but it is obvious that it's about the Empire aggression lately. Out of the seven participating countries, only France, the Allied Kingdom and the Legadonian Federation signed a defensive alliance. However, all of the countries signed the economic pact the conference offered. Overall, the conference was considered a failure by the Republicans as only 3 countries signed a defensive treaty against the Empire. "

 news.916.d:0 "Earlier this morning, Republican troops have moved swiftly through the Republic-Empire border and occupied Alsace. Republican officials have claimed that Alsace was always a state of the Republic, and it should stay that way. It seems that by giving away Scania to the Legadonia Federation, a new weakness of the Empire was shown to the world, and new countries are beginning to claim imperial territories for themselves."
 news.916.a:0 "Eternal peace? Or more claims?"
 news.917.t:0 "Czechoslovakia is Free!"
 news.917.d:0 "Further military ultimatums have been placed on the Empire by its surronding neighbors, and thus it had to release the nation of the Czechs and Slovaks, because if not - many Czechs and Slovaks have threatened to gather a rebellion to overthrow the Empire. The democratic republic was proclaimed although not many nations have rushed to open diplomatic relations with it."

 empire.10.a:0 "At last!"
 empire.11.t:0 "The Republic Rejects"
 empire.11.d:0 "It seems that the Republic rejected our offer to join their military alliance. After all we did, after we gave away imperial lands and released entire nations, they say no? We showed the entire world that we are not a threatening force, and yet the world does not accept it."
 empire.11.a:0 "We must get revenge!"
 news.918.t:0 "The Empire sells Jutland"
 news.918.d:0 "The Legadonian Federation has accepted to buy the Jutland region from the Empire in exchange for ending all hostilities between the two countries. The last Empire soldier left Jutland this morning and many imperial citizens have moved out to the new border to stay in their former country. The population in the region did not seem so happy about joining the Legadonian Federation, as it does not offer as much as the Empire does."
 news.918.a:0 "Jutland is no longer an imperial territory"
 empire.12.t:0 "The Allied Kingdom Accepts"
 empire.12.d:0 "Long ago, when we first set foot on the African continent, we thought we will become richer from its resources, amd a lot more powerful that we finaly have a foothold in Africa. It seems that nothing has changed since then, except that we now have to waste a lot of money to maintain our colony. It will be much better to obtain a foothold in Asia though. We will be able to trade more with the numerous Asian countries in the region, and it will also enable us to send troops far away from our home to aid our distant allies. "
 empire.12.a:0 "For a more prosperous Vaterland!"
 republic.501.t:0 "Dismantle Our Faction?"
 republic.501.d:0 "We've created this so-called military alliance for the sole purpose of defending against the might of the Empire. But now, as we saw it does no longer pose a threat to Europe, this military alliance has no goal whatsoever. The Empire has recently asked us to dismantle this military alliance, as it is now a threat to the Empire's safety. What should we do? Dismantling the alliance comes at a price. We will no longer recieve any aid from our strong allies."
 republic.501.a:0 "Accept"
 republic.501.b:0 "Refuse"
 empire.13.t:0 "The Republic Accepts" 
 empire.13.d:0 "It seems that we have recieved a positive answer from the Republic, and the coalition will soon disband. We did not threaten anyone ever, and this military alliance was created for the sole purpose of attacking us. Now, we are finally safe."
 empire.13.a:0 "At last!"
 empire.14.t:0 "The Republic Refuses"
 empire.14.d:0 "The treacharous Republic refused our request to dismantle their coalition, even though we are not a threat to Europe anymore. This just shows that the sole purpose of the alliance was not to defend against us, it was to attack us. We must prepare for the worst, and mobilize our forces to crush it!"

 empire.15.t:0 "Release Czechoslovakia"

 empire.15.a:0 "Hey, new neighbor!"
 empire.16.t:0 "The Russy Federation Must Pay"
 empire.16.d:0 "The Russy Federation has always been a threatening force on our eastern border. It is obvious that if we will not declare the war soon, they will. We must make them pay in blood for the terror they brought to the world!"
 empire.16.a:0 "Declare a Holy War!"
 empire.17.t:0 "The Republic Must Pay"
 empire.17.d:0 "It is time to destroy our mortal enemies. Those who seek to destroy our mighty empire. Those who seek to devastate our people. We must eradicate them from our world and bring peace and prosperity to the Central Powers and Europe!"
 empire.17.a:0 "It is time!"
 empire.21.t:0 "Purge the Army"
 empire.21.d:0 "The time has come to purge the unfaithful from our banners, and replace them with man who are loyal to our new proclaimed republic. This very important move might create a bit chaos and maybe even a small mutinity, but it will purify our armies and make them better in the end. What should we choose, dear president? "

 empire.22.a:0 "For a new and lasting peace!"
 empire.23.t:0 "Berlun Promise"
 empire.23.d:0 "Our empire spreads across vast amounts of land from Belgium to Hungary, and we cannot turn a blind eye anymore, especially now when we're expected to bring peace and prosperity to Europe. Czech independence movements are now fairly popular in the Czech and Slovak regions, and the people have decided to start protesting. If we were to promise these people independence, our popularity in the continent will surely rise, and many nations will see us as less threatening. But if we were to do so, other minorities might rise up and also ask for independence. What should we decide?"
 empire.23.a:0 "The Berlun Conference"
 empire.23.b:0 "Back down"
 empire.24.t:0 "Our New Trade Policy"
 empire.24.d:0 "Now that we have opened our borders for foreign trade and changed our trade policy we are in a position to choose many trade agreements from a lot of different countries. Some of these countries have proposed some trading offers for valuable resources. Who should we trade with?"

 empire.25.t:0 "Pact against the Russy Federation"
 empire.25.d:0 "The Empire has sent delegates to many neighboring countries proposing a defensive pact with each signing member if attacked by the Russy Federation. It might benefit us in the long run, as the Federation is indeed a threatening force at our doorsteps, but it might also damage us as we don't know much about the Empire's ambitions. Should we sign the pact?"
 empire.25.a:0 "Sign it."
 empire.25.b:0 "Decline."
 empire.26.t:0 "Hiltria Accepts"
 empire.26.d:0 "Earlier this morning we have recieved a radio message stating that the country of Hiltria has accepted our demand for the region of Zara.

 empire.27.t:0 "Hiltria Declines"
 empire.27.d:0 "Earlier this morning we have recieved a radio message stating that the country of Hiltria has declined our demand for the region of Zara. '...Zara is a very important part of our country and citizens, and we will never give it to a foreign force.' was their explanation. We are left with no choice but to accept the humiliating answer."
 empire.27.a:0 "We just wanted this small region!"
 empire.28.t:0 "A secret treaty with the Russy Federation?"
 empire.28.d:0 "It is well known that the Russy Federation is our enemy. The strongest one. But to achieve our goals, we must deal with the devil first. Our military advisors have come with an idea to form a non-agression pact with the Russy Federation. Of course, the pact wouldn't last for long, as its sole purpose is to buy time for us to acquire more territories and achieve our militaristic ambitions. Should we form the pact? Our neighbors won't like it, especially our enemies."
 empire.28.a:0 "Send the proposal!"
 empire.28.b:0 "No way we'll accept such a proposal."
 empire.29.t:0 "The Russy Federation Rejects the Treaty"
 empire.29.d:0 "Russy officials have just sent us a message regarding our secret proposal. It seems they declined it, and are not wishing to cooperate with us.

 empire.29.a:0 "Damn them!"
 empire.30.t:0 "The Russy Federation Accepts!"
 empire.30.d:0 "It seems the Russy Federation has accepted our proposal of a secret non-agression pact. We have sent our finest general, von Zettour, to sign the secret treaty near our shared border in Lublin. This great move will surely benefit our country, and we shall be ready for the real fight soon."
 empire.30.a:0 "The Vaterland does not know defeat."
 empire.31.t:0 "Speech of the Emperor"
 empire.31.d:0 "Earlier today, the Emperor has given a very important speech to the public through the radio. In the speech, the emperor commented on the need to rearm the country to defend from foreign evil powers such as the Republic and the Russy Federation. In addition to that, he also praised the people for cooperating with the government in repairing the economy. '..the Empire is much more stable today, because of you - the people...' he said."

 empire.32.d:0 "An Ildoan delegation has arrived earlier this morning with a proposal of an armistice between our two countries, which states that the Ildoan Kingdom will transfer ownership of the Istrian region to us in exchange for peace between our countries and no further land claiming. Should we accept the armistice? After all, the whole purpose of the war was to annex Istria and show our superiority to the Ildoans."
 empire.32.a:0 "Accept the armistice."
 empire.32.b:0 "Reject it."
 empire.200.t:0 "The African Campaign"
 empire.200.d:0 "It seems that The Republic has not fully surrendered. Moments after our forces entered Parisii, most of The Republican Free Army has already sailed to the colonies, mainly North Africa, to continue the fight. All our attempts to pursue peace with them have been met with failure. The Francois puppet we have set up has managed to occupy north Tunis and has asked us to support the effort with the African campaign. Should we send there troops and eventually manage to drive the Republican Free Army away? Or should we first center on Europe only?"
 empire.200.a:0 "Send the Afrika Corps!"

 empire.500.d:0 "We have just recieved a high-classified important report from the northern HQ, sir! It seems that some Legadonian forces have started moving to our shared border in Scania! Legadonian artillery is mass shooting and soldiers are advancing rapidly. We have to prepare our forces and defend our lands as fast as possible!"
 empire.500.a:0 "Defend, Strike, Take!"
 empire.501.t:0 "Our soldiers are victorious"
 empire.501.d:0 "After a couple days of inconclusive skirmishes at the northern front in Norden, our soldiers there report that the Legadonian troops have fled the area, leaving their borders undefended. Our Chief of Staff Lieutenant General von Ludwig and the majority in the General Staff have elected to mobilize the reserves to start an invasion of the Entente Alliance. They state that with Legadonian troops on the retreat and unorganised, it is safe to say that they will surrender quickly. There is no sign that anyone else has mobilized, so it's unlikely that someone will attack us if we do invade. However, the Deputy Chief of Operations von Rudersdorf, along with Deputy Chief of the Service Corps, von Zettour, are against an all out attack, highlighting that such an invasion goes against Plan 315 and would leave us vulnerable, and the Entente Alliance is so weak to begin with that there's little to gain from invading them."
 empire.501.a:0 "The Legadonians have picked a fight and they shall get it."
 empire.501.b:0 "We are not ready, yet."
 empire.502.t:0 "We have lost."
 empire.502.d:0 "Legadonian forces have outnumbered us, and overpowered us with their mass artillery and mage shooting. It is not the fault of our military though, as we were caught offguard by the cowardly Legadonians. We must take Scania back someday."

 empire.504.t:0 "Rudersdorf's Plan"
 empire.504.d:0 " One of our army chiefs advisors, Kurt von Rudersdork, came up with a plan to expand the armed forced and get new recruits. The plan includes an alternative to our strict recruitment policy, which will increase the number of soliders eligible for recruitment. The only disadvantage of the plan is that our army would not be able to keep its level of quality. Do we proceed with the plan?"

 #1920 elections
 empire.505.t:0 "The 1920 Elections"
 empire.505.d:0 "The 1918 economic crisis threatened to destroy our Fatherland. Many Imperial citizens lost their homes, destined to die on the street. Our currency became essentially useless due to inflation, citizens often preferred to burn their money to stay warm rather than attempt to scrounge up enough to buy food. The crisis continued until government intervention began to improve the situation by the end of 1919. However, even in 1920, the aftershocks of the initial disaster are still felt. In fact, reforming the economy is the main issue discussed by the political parties vying for power in the 1920 elections. \n\nThe Monarchists are assumed to be the victors of the election, they favor economic independence and the nationalization of certain valuable companies. They also hope to reform the military into the most formidable fighting force on the continent. \n\nThe Monarchists' main rivals are the Democratic faction. Hoping to reform the Empire into a bastion of democracy, the Democrats faction plan to open up trade with the other democracies of our continent and issue government bailouts to struggling companies. \n\nThe final political group cotending in the election are the Communists. Before the economic crisis, the Communists were reserved to small splinter factions protesting the Monarchist government. However, due to the crisis, they began to gather a larger following. The communists wish to expand workers' rights and give back to the common people. Though, they have rather radical ideas about the fate of the Emperor and those loyal to him... \n\nWho will guide the Fatherland through this tumultuous time?"
