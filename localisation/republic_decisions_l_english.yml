The plan was however changed to include the formation of forts in the southern side, along the shared border of Ildoa in case of a surprise attack."

 REP_deloffre_decisions_desc:0 "Economic minister Deloffre has drawn up a daring and innovative relief plan designed to counter the current economic crisis. Although this plan has some vocal opposition from the more conservative members of the High Cabinet, the socialist policies contained within the plan have found a great deal of support from the more liberal members, who believe these more radical measures are necessary in order to stimulate economic growth. The plan involves the Government investing in industry and infrastructure as a way to ease unemployment and hopefully begin reversing the current recession. \n\nCombined with the upcoming reforms, it is hoped that this will lay the foundations for economic growth and eventually lead to a full recovery."
