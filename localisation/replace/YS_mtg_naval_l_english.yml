 battleship_1_desc:0 "The Dreadnought was a major evolution in battleships. It carried only a single caliber of main guns, allowing different turrets to share firing solutions."
 battleship_2_desc:0 "Superdreadnoughts evolved from the original Dreadnought, addressing issues such as inadequate deck protection from plunging shells fired from previously unexpected distances, and placing all turrets on the centerline so that all of them can fire on either side of the ship."
 battleship_3_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs to face the ever-changing advancement in ship designs."
 battleship_4_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
