 CHI_revoke_concessions_desc:0 "For too long we have suffered at the hands of foreigners, who step on our dignity and take away our land piecemeal. It's time to put an end to it."
 CHI_revoke_manchuria_concession:0 "Plot to Revoke the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] Concession"
 CHI_revoke_manchuria_concession_desc:0 "While the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] Concession is still legally part of our country, the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] have taken control of the railway, the factories, the resources, everything. We are not even allowed to move our armies there. It's time to put an end to this travesty."
 youjo_china.1.t:0 "[CHI.GetName] pressuring [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] Concession Authority"
 youjo_china.1.d:0 "\n[CHI.GetName] issued an official complaint regarding the status of the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] Concession in [CHI.GetName]. The said concession was originally granted to the Russy Empire, but was later seized by [JAP.GetName] in a war. [CHI.GetName] argued that the transfer of concession was void because it not ratified by the host country, and the lease became null when Russy Empire, the lease holder, fell in a revolution."
 youjo_china.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 youjo_china.2.t:0 "Riot in the concession in [CHI.GetName]"
 youjo_china.2.d:0 "A mob of [CHI.GetAdjectiveCap] citizens attacked the headquarters of the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] railway company in the concession. While the initial mob has been dispersed by the railway guards, the [CHI.GetAdjectiveCap] is trying to enter the concession zone to \"restore order\". Obviously, they have ulterior motives, but whether this concession is worth fighting another war over is your decision."
 youjo_china.2.a:0 "This is unacceptable. Tell the railway guard to dig in, we are going to war."
 youjo_china.2.b:0 "Fight ANOTHER war over this concession? It's not worth it at all!"
 youjo_china.3.t:0 "War between [JAP.GetName] and [CHI.GetName]!"
 youjo_china.3.d:0 "Earlier today, a firefight broke out between [CHI.GetAdjectiveCap] and [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] forces following a riot in the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] Concession in [CHI.GetName]. [CHI.GetAdjectiveCap] forces marched into the demilitarized concession in the name of restoring order, but the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] government considered this a gross violation of their concession and responded with force. [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] railway guards have dugged in along the railway, allowing the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] army to reach deep into the concession."
 youjo_china.3.a:0 "Here we go again."
 youjo_china.4.t:0 "[JAP.GetName] returns concessions in [CHI.GetName]"
 youjo_china.4.d:0 "Following a riot in the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] Concession in [CHI.GetName], the [JAP.GetAdjectiveCap] government decided to relinquish control and allowed [CHI.GetAdjectiveCap] forces to take over the concession zone. The move is seen as a sign that the local balance of power has tipped, and experts warn that [CHI.GetName] could come after other foreign concessions next."
 youjo_china.4.a:0 "Surprising."
 JAP_Railway_Guards:0 "Mantetsu Shubi Rentai"
