 iwc_military_event.1.d:0 "The General Assembly members are not very happy with the current military spendings policy. They accuse the General Staff of dismissing their warnings and abusing the budget given to them, furthermore going beyond it.

 iwc_military_event.1.a:0 "Accept their terms."
 iwc_military_event.1.b:0 "Huh? Who do they think they are?"
 iwc_military_event.2.t:0 "The General Staff Protests"
 iwc_military_event.2.d:0 "Some of our generals are getting tired of the nonsense of the General Assembly. They threaten with retirement and state that the General Assembly is restricting the armed forces and that can prove to be a dangerous threat to national security. In addition, they say that the General Assembly is corrupt and unjust, caring just for their members and not for the emperor and the country."
 iwc_military_event.2.a:0 "Trust the generals."

 iwc_military_event.3.t:0 "Generals Riot"
 iwc_military_event.3.d:0 "The General Staff has been very angry because of the recent budget cuts imposed on the armed forces and the amount of control the General Assembly possesses over the army.

If the state won't agree to the terms, the armed forces might rebel and overthrow the current emperor!"
 iwc_military_event.4.a:0 "We must agree!"
 iwc_military_event.4.b:0 "The emperor over all."
 iwc_military_event.5.t:0 "The General Assembly Riots"
 iwc_military_event.5.d:0 "The General Assembly is without a doubt, very mad of our recent policies and also worried for the future of our country. They state that The Empire is heading to a dangerous path, and if we don't do something to 'appease' them, they will riot and take force against our actions. Basically, they are threatening the existence of our country."
 iwc_military_event.5.a:0 "Submit to their demands"
 iwc_military_event.5.b:0 "Threatening? Us?!"
 iwc_military_event.6.t:0 "General Assembly is Outraged!"
 iwc_military_event.6.d:0 "After ignoring their demands for a couple of times, the council members of the General Assembly have given up any hope to negotiate a fair deal with the General Staff and are now taking revenge by making the lives of our people miserable! They have bribed some of our soldiers to join their cause and have closed several weapon factories across the country. This is a rebellion! What should we do?"
 iwc_military_event.6.a:0 "Get them whatever they want already!"
 iwc_military_event.6.b:0 "Damn them... send the military!"
