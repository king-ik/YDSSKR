 EMP_industrial_disaster_desc:0 "The 1918 Industrial Disaster is a general name for the series of economic crashes that happened in the Empire in early 1918 and continued all the way to 1919. The outcome was gruesome: inflation was very high, families were left homeless, the army was in shatters. It was only in late 1919 when the government has began to pass reforms and improve the economy. The disaster started 2 years ago and its outcome still shakes our economy. We must repair the economy to have the ability to properly defend our country and improve the life of our citizens."
