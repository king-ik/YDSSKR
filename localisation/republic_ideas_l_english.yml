 REP_economic_collapse_desc:0 "Although it originated in the Empire, the effects of 1918 Industrial disaster echoed around the world and with the Republic’s close proximity to the epicentre of the crisis, it has felt the effects more than most. The disaster has caused many François businesses into bankruptcy or forced them into almost unmanageable debt. This, in turn, has led to mass unemployment, hyperinflation, and homelessness, with entire families now living on the streets. Worse still the government’s slow and uncoordinated response to the situation has only worsened the effects of the economic crash. This has resulted in strikes, civil unrest and a general mistrust of the country’s leadership. We must repair our economy if we are to rebuild the people's trust and secure a future for the Republic."
 REP_widespread_apathy:0 "Widespread Apathy"
 REP_widespread_apathy_desc:0 "The Republican Army was once one of the best in the world, sadly this is no longer the case. Much of the army leadership is corrupt and simply does not care how the armed forces are being managed. Some Generals have even been found accepting bribes in exchange for promotions and assignments to influential positions leading to poorly qualified officers in key posts.\n\nWithout effective leadership, our forces have been left disorganised and ineffective. Can we even fight a war with such men in command?"
