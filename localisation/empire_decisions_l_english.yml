 EMP_recover_plan_one_desc:0 "After putting much emphasis on recovering from the 1918 economic crisis, our advisors came up with a seperate plan to help our crumbling economy. By offering more jobs to the common civilians, and making the soldiers work too, we will be able to recover much faster. Currently we cannot spare any funds though, so we will have to repay the workers later."

 EMP_opel_marchese:0 "Opel-Marchese"
 EMP_opel_marchese_desc:0 "Shortly after the economic crash of 1918, our military downsized to just 1/3 of what it was beforehand. Many left the army, and the ones who did not, were forcefully sent home because the country couldn't keep them there. The military expenses were cut by the action, but it still wasn't enough. The economic disaster is now far behind us, and now that we have begun to repair our economy, we need to make the imperial army great again. We can offer car and forniture companies to produce military equipment and in return publically advocate them."

 EMP_recruitment:0 "Recruitment Policy"
 EMP_recruitment_desc:0 "Our recruitment policy is very unique. While we conscript the cream of the crop regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or age and train them hard, we don't accept average people who don't speak fluent Imperial into the army even if they want to. By training a cadre of bilingual officers, we would be able to recruit volunteers everywhere in the Empire regardless of their language."

 EMP_construct_the_hippel_line_desc:0 "Rudolf Hippel is one of the most astounding and high-ranked airforce chiefs the Empire possesses, but among his many skills, he is known as an expert in the field of bunkers and forts. Long ago he proposed to build a long line of forts that stretches along the Rhine and continues up to Holland in case of a surprise Republican attack. Although his proposal was never accepted, now that we are in a state of war with the Republic and our core industry in the Rhineland is under immediate threat, we must consider the proposal again."

Although she is very young, her vast knowledge and skills prove to be a major battle-changer. Let's show her our appreciation by promoting her!"
 EMP_replace_francois_industry:0 "Relocate Francois Industry"
 EMP_replace_francois_industry_desc:0 "At last, Parisii is ours and the Francois Republic has fallen. Now, the question of the Francois industry arises. The General Assembly proposes to relocate the industry to our heartland, Berlun. The General Staff strongly objects as such thing will cost much manpower and money. If we leave the industry where it is now, threat of Allied bombing will always be present."
