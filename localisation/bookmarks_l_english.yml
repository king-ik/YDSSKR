Its economy is strong, even though it mainly consists of agriculture. The Republic has enjoyed a relatively long period of peace, however the times are changing quickly. Its powerful neighbour to the east, The Empire, which has always possessed a great threat to the Republic, has been acting aggressively the past couple of years. In its current position, the Republic is in no position to wage and fight a long and costly war. To survive in this world, we must make sure we are able to."
 EMP_1920_DESC:0 "The Empire, or alternatively The Fatherland, is a powerful nation residing in the alternate Earth of which the main character, Tanya Degurechaff, was sent to following her first encounter with Being X. It is characterized by a strong military and rationalist attitude towards warfare. Surrounded by enemies from all sides, the empire must stand strong both diplomatically and militaristically and eliminate those who seek for its complete and total destruction. The Empire must move forward and withhold its ideals to survive in the harsh reality of this cruel and unforgiving world."
 LEG_1920_DESC:0 "Described as the country 'of mountains and snow', the Legadonia Federation is a democratic nation located north of the Empire. Legadonia is considered by many to be the first victim of Imperial aggression, a direct result of the Treaty of Londinium. Legadonia is in a weak position: To the south, the ever power-hungry imperialists and to the east, the communist red bear. As war clouds grow over Europe and war seem inevitable, Legadonia must renew its alliances, reach to new countries, stand strong and resist any invading armies - no matter from which direction they might come."
 JAP_1920_DESC:0 "This country's history status is similar to the Empire of Japan in 1900s. It had an official dispute with the Rus' Union over the drawing of the national border."
 RUS_1920_DESC:0 "Even though the Russy Federation is a relatively new country, emerging just a couple years ago from a brutal civil war - it is one of the most influential and powerful countries in the world. The only communist state in Europe, the Russy Federation possesses the biggest army the world has ever seen. The federation is still recovering from the brutal civil war it had with the nationalists a few years ago, and thus it doesn't have the economic means to wage a war, yet. There are many enemies who seek to destroy our great nation and annihilate communism from the face of the world. The federation will survive, destroy its enemies and fight on!"
 USA_1920_DESC:0 "Known as the beacon of liberty and hope, the Unified States of America is a large isolationist country located in North America. It has enjoyed a long period of peace thanks to its isolationism policy and tends to not intervene with any European affairs. Its army is small but very well trained, and possesses some of the best mages in the entire world. The states' economy is largely composed of agriculture, but its oil industry is one of the wealthiest in the world. Although the country is located far away from Europe, there was always the possibility of getting into a war with one of the great powers someday. In times that technology is rapidly advancing, the threat is ever so close."
 DAC_1920_DESC:0 "Many would falsely link the Grand Duchy of Dacia as just another minor state in Europe, when in truth, Dacia, a very small country compared to its neighbours, has stood firmly for hundreds of years. The country's current situation doesn't look good however: Dacia had yet to achieve full industrialization like most countries did, and the last war its army had participated in was decades ago. In addition to that, Dacia cannot proclaim neutrality as it is an important bridge between rivaling power-hungry nations. If the duchy seeks to continue its independence, it must sacrifice everything to advance forward towards the unforeseeable future."
 ILD_1920_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Ildoa is a self-proclaimed neutral country located in the south of the Empire and east of the François Republic. Ruled by Prince Ramundo I, the country has enjoyed a large amount of prosperity and peace due to its diplomatic policy of neutrality in European wars. Ildoa is in a unique and favourable position: although it lacks both the large military and industrial base of her neighbours and is certainly not prepared for large-scale warfare, it's her which keeps the balance of power from potentially changing if a European war breaks out."
 OTHER_1920_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the many years of peace and prosperity, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
