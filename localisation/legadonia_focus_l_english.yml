 LEG_national_reserve_act:0 "Pass the National Reserve Act"
 LEG_national_reserve_act_desc:0 "The cause of the last crisis seems to have been the failure of several large banks that triggered a domino effect.

 LEG_end_of_gold_standard:0 "End the Gold Standard"
 LEG_end_of_gold_standard_desc:0 "Several economists have proposed devaluing our currency in order to attract more investments from other countries.

 #I'm vetoing changing "Import Subsitution" to "Substitute our Imports"
 LEG_import_substitution_desc:0 "We are importing a lot of products that we can manufacture domestically, which is causing a trade deficit.

 LEG_tender_system:0 "Encourage Procurement Bidding"

 LEG_trans_legadonian_railway_desc:0 "The idea of linking up the southern rail network to the rest of the country has several advantages, from both an economical perspective and also from a strategic one.

 LEG_osfjord_shipyards:0 "Osfjord Shipyards"
 LEG_osfjord_shipyards_desc:0 "If we ever plan to revitalize our outdated navy, we will need modern shipyards. Given its strategic location and its history as a major port, Osjford is the obvious choice. The existing shipyard will need to be expanded and new ones will be founded."

 LEG_rural_industrialization_initiative_desc:0 "Decentralizing our industrial manufacturing sector will ensure both the growth of new cities but will also allow us to keep supplying our troops with equipment if we lose the capital region.

 LEG_norland_arsenal:0 "Norrland Arsenal"

 LEG_market_revitalization:0 "Revitalize the Markets"
 LEG_market_revitalization_desc:0 "Our measures seem to have worked and the economy has returned to its pre-crisis levels.

 LEG_local_autonomy_desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a vast country and it currently takes a long time for approval from the capital to reach the more remote areas.

 LEG_seek_corporate_support:0 "Seek Corporate Support"
 LEG_seek_corporate_support_desc:0 "In many ways, corporations have more control over people’s lives than the government. We should reach out to these organisations and encourage them to support our rule. After all, companies do not care who is in charge as long as there is money to be made."

 LEG_autogestion:0 "Grant Self-Management"
 LEG_autogestion_desc:0 "The workers have demanded they be allowed self-management free from the oppressive eyes of their capitalist overseers. How could we ignore the plight of our common worker? We will allow them self-management, which will undoubtedly increase their productivity."

 LEG_claim_on_empire_desc:0 "Before the Unification of the Empire, Legadonia’s sphere of influence reached much further than our peninsula in northern Europe.

 LEG_relentless_assault:0 "Relentless Assault"
 LEG_relentless_assault_desc:0 "We must keep up the pressure on the Empire if we are to attain final victory in this war.

 LEG_militarized_schools:0 "Militarized Schools"
 LEG_militarized_schools_desc:0 "While some say that the youth is the future of the nation, there will be no future for them if the nation falls.

 LEG_legadonia_persevered:0 "Legadonia Preserved"
 LEG_legadonia_persevered_desc:0 "At long last, we have driven back our enemies and recovered our lost territories. But at what cost?

 LEG_behind_enemy_lines:0 "Behind Enemy Lines"
 LEG_behind_enemy_lines_desc:0 "We may be losing ground but we still have the will to fight! We need to hold on so that our allies can launch a counteroffensive.

 LEG_prepare_for_exile_desc:0 "The war situation has developed, not necessarily to [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s advantage.

 LEG_allied_volunteer_desc:0 "[ALK.GetNameDef] has made no secret that they are displeased with us since the denunciation of the Londinium Treaty and the subsequent trouble we have created in its wake.

 LEG_overseas_volunteer:0 "Expat Volunteers"
 LEG_overseas_volunteer_desc:0 "During the economic woes that befell our nation, a great many of our people travelled abroad in order to find work and financial stability.

 LEG_war_on_communism:0 "War on Communism"
 LEG_war_on_communism_desc:0 "[EMP.GetNameDef] may no longer be a threat, but its absence has revealed another, perhaps greater danger.

 LEG_counterinsurgency_desc:0 "Sadly, not everyone is willing to embrace the dreams of the Fatherland and its people.

 LEG_attack_russy:0 "Revenge for the Northern War"
 LEG_attack_russy_desc:0 "The Empire was not the only enemy to humiliate us and take land that rightfully belongs to our great nation.

 LEG_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "The Baltic Sea is now the undisputed property of Legadonia. As we pile on the victories and our people become ever more prosperous, we look to look to the horizon and find that this sea no longer marks the edge of our great nation. They are only the beginning of it."
 LEG_the_other_sea:0 "Assert Dominance over Storbritannien"
 LEG_the_other_sea_desc:0 "It was the Treaty of Londinium that once tied the hands of our nation and it was the Allied kingdom that was the architects of that unfair agreement.

 LEG_army_commissars:0 "Army Commissars"
 LEG_army_commissars_desc:0 "Although many of our soldiers have proven themselves great heroes of the people, some of the officers have yet to embrace the great socialist ideals that have grown in our country.

 LEG_attack_francois:0 "Strike the source of Democracy"
 LEG_attack_francois_desc:0 "The Bourgeoisie may call themselves democratic but in truth, their democracy is merely a pretext to enslave the workers under their capitalist ideals!

 LEG_new_battlecruiser_desc:0 "With so much of our country exposed to the ocean, it is imperative we build a strong navy to discourage amphibious assaults. We have a near completed state-of-the-art battlecruiser that is rusting in a drydock because of budget cuts. Finishing its construction would be a good start for our new navy. We should pay to resume work on it as soon as possible."
 LEG_modern_destroyers:0 "Modern Destroyers"
 LEG_modern_destroyers_desc:0 "Carriers and Battleships may be marvels of engineering, but it is the destroyer that forms the backbone of any Navy. We must modernise these sturdy workhorses to serve as the foundation of our new navy."
 LEG_modern_cruisers:0 "Modern Cruisers"
 LEG_modern_cruisers_desc:0 "Although useful for a multitude of roles the humble destroyer simply cannot stand up to larger foes in combat. We now need to modernise our cruisers to deal with larger threats. These ships may be smaller than a battleship, but they are faster and more nimble as well as much easier to produce. They will be a worthy addition to the navy."
 LEG_naval_doctrines:0 "Naval Doctrine Effort"
 LEG_naval_doctrines_desc:0 "Modernising our navy is not enough, we must also update the way we use our naval vessels. The war at sea will not be won by superior firepower but by the cunning use of tactics and equipment. We must make sure we remain at the forefront of these endeavours."
 LEG_ship_design_bureau:0 "Ship Design Bureau"
 LEG_ship_design_bureau_desc:0 "Larger ships do not make a superior navy. The superior navy is the one that is better designed and equipped so it can deal with potential threats.

 #Army
 LEG_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"

 LEG_small_arms_effort_desc:0 "While the army might be well-trained, it may not be well equipped. Our current firearms and associated gadgets must be inspected, and used as models for more advanced weaponry. That way, Legadonia may have the slight advantage when our forces clash with the enemies'."
 LEG_artillery_effort:0 "Artillery Effort"

 LEG_armor_effort:0 "Armor Effort"
 LEG_armor_effort_desc:0 "We must renew our research efforts, as our foray into armored vehicles has been lacking as of late.

We must ensure Legadonia's tank corps can withstand the assault of our foes."
 LEG_nco_corps:0 "NCO Corps"
 LEG_nco_corps_desc:0 "An experienced corps of NCOs is a requirement for a well-functioning army.

With this, we hope to be able to stay on top and utilize more advanced tactics when defeating our enemy."
 LEG_mage_corps:0 "Mage Corps"
 LEG_mage_corps_desc:0 "As the use of specialized mage forces has become widespread among many nations, we must follow suit and establish our own mage corps. Firstly, we shall request for lease of mage orbs, to which we can reverse-engineer for usage. Secondly, we must seek users with magical abilities to recruit into our forces and hone our newly created orbs. Once both those steps are complete, Legadonia can perhaps stand toe-to-toe with the mages of the Empire."
 LEG_special_forces:0 "Army Specialist Focus"
 LEG_special_forces_desc:0 "As Legadonia is defined by thick forests and frozen mountaintops, its people are naturally acclimated to the conditions. Several promising soldiers will be selected for specialist training, which will be significantly easier due to their ability to adapt to the environment presented to them. With this, where the Empire's troops will flounder, Legadonia's will thrive."
 LEG_military_research_institute:0 "Military Research Institute"
 LEG_military_research_institute_desc:0 "With the establishment and success of the Army Bureau, the Legadonian government has approved the creation of a research institute aimed at military usage.

 #Air
 LEG_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
 LEG_fighter_focus_desc:0 "In both offense and defence, fighters are the basis of air warfare. At home, they form the basis of our defense against aerial assault.

 LEG_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Bombers form the backbone of both strategic and tactical air warfare. They can damage both enemy fortifications and matériel in and around the combat area as well as strike war sustaining targets far away from the front lines. These flying machines can deliver payloads that can strike at the enemy morale itself. We would be fools to neglect this part of our armed forces."
 LEG_CAS_focus:0 "Air Support Focus"
 LEG_CAS_focus_desc:0 "Perhaps the most useful use of our aircraft is in direct support of our units on the ground.
